// This is our entity/model that represents the information that will be persisted into the database. 
// Entities don't always make the best models for a view because quite often a view will need more information than you can have in a single entity. In such situations, it is a good idea to build a View Model, whose only responsibility is to provide all the information and behavior that is needed for one specific view. 
// Entity Framework will look at these data annotations and add them as constraints in the database that it's trying to create ([Required] would mean not nullable)

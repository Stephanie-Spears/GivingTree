==========================================================================
* (General C# Notes) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The "virtual" keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. For example, this method can be overridden by any class that inherits it:

	public virtual double Area()
	{
		return x * y;
	}

* The implementation of a virtual member can be changed by an overriding member in a derived class. 
* When a virtual method is invoked, the run-time type of the object is checked for an overriding member. The overriding member in the most derived class is called, which might be the original member, if no derived class has overriden the member. 
* By default, methods are non-virtual. You cannot override a non-virtual method.
* You cannot use the virtual modifier with the static, abstract, private, or override modifiers. 

* The "abstract" modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
* In this example, the class Square must provide an implementation of GetArea() becasue it derives from Shape:

	abstract class Shape
	{
		public abstract int GetArea();
	}

	class Square : Shape 
	{
		int side;
		public Square(int n) => side = n;

		//GetArea() method is required to avoid compile-time error
		public override int GetArea() => side * side;

		static void Main()
		{
			var sq = new Square(12);
			Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
		}
	}
	// Output: Area of the square = 144


* Abstract classes have the following features: 
	* An abstract class cannot be instantiated
	* An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors
	* It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the "sealed" modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The "sealed" modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.
	* A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.

* Use the abstract modifier in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.

* Abstract Methods have the following features:
	* An abstract method is implicitly a virutal method
	* Abstract method decalrations are only permitted in abstract classes
	* Because an abstract method declarations provides no actual implementation, there is no method body; the method declaration simply ends with a semicolon and there are no curly braces ({}) following the signature. The implementation is provided by a method override, which is a member of a non-abstract class. For Exmaple: 

		public abstract void MyMethod();

* The "volatile" keyword indicates that a field might be modified by multiple threads that are executing at the same time. The compiler, runtime system, and even hardware may rearrange reads and writes to memory locations for performance reasons. Fields that are declared volitile are not subject to these optimizations. Adding the "volitile" modifier ensures taht all threads will observe volitile writes performed by any other thread in the order in which they are performed.
* The volitile keyword can only be applied ot fields of a class or struct. Local variables cannot be decared volitile.

* You use "void" as the return type of a method to specify that it doesn't return a value. You can also use void as a referent type to declare a pointer to an unknown type. 

* Use the "static" modifier to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object. The static modifier can be used to declare static classes. In classes, interfaces, and structs, you can add the static modifier to fields, methods, properties, operators, events, and constructors. The static modififer can't be used with indexers or finalizers. 
* While an instance of a class contains a separate copy of all instance fields of the class, there's only one copy of each static field.
* To demonstrate static members, consider a class that represents a company employee. Assume that the class contains a method to count employees and a field to store the number of employees. Both the method and the field don't belong to any one employee instance. Instead, they belong to the class of employees as a whole. They should be declared as static members of the class.

* An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide implementation of the members defined in the interface. It may also define default implementation of it's members in the case that inheriting classes don't provide the implementation themselves.

An event may be declared as a static event by using the static keyword. This makes the event available to callers at any time, even if no instance of the class exists. For more information, see Static Classes and Static Class Members.

* An event can be marked as a virtual event by using the virtual keyword. This enables derived classes to override the event behavior by using the override keyword. For more information, see Inheritance. An event overriding a virtual event can also be sealed, which specifies that for derived classes it is no longer virtual. Lastly, an event can be declared abstract, which means that the compiler will not generate the add and remove event accessor blocks. Therefore derived classes must provide their own implementation.

* When applied to a class, the "sealed" modifier prevents other classes from inheriting it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class B:

	class A{}
	sealed class B : A {}

* (General Debugging Notes) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Autos and Locals Windows*
 * The Autos and Locals windows show variable values while you are debugging. The windows are only available during a debugging session. The Autos window shows variables used around the current breakpoint. The Locals window shows variables defined in the local scope, which is usually the current function or method.

 * Immediate Window *
Use the Immediate window to debug and evaluate expressions, execute statements, and print variable values. The Immediate window evaluates expressions by building and using the currently selected project.

To display the Immediate window, open a project for editing, and then choose Debug > Windows > Immediate or press Ctrl+Alt+I. You can also enter Debug.Immediate in the Command window.

Typing this into the immediate window gives the same results, the '?' form is shorthand. Both return "Google":
	>Debug.Print loginProviders[0].Caption
	? loginProviders[0].Caption


==========================================================================
* (HPlusSports Project - Business Logic & View Models) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This solution is split into two projects, "Website" and "Common". Common contains all of the data access logic, and other business-related classes. The Website project contains only models related to the web application, such as view models.

* Business Logic - defines how your business works, not related to any framework or platform.
	Ex: how you manage product inventory or fulfill customer orders (doesn't have anything to do with the asp.net framework)

* A View Model is a class whose only purpose is to encapsulate and carry all the information that is needed to render a view. Some of the models in the application may serve a dual purpose. 


==========================================================================
* (Reducing Namespace Refrences with Global Imports) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside Views/Web.config there's a list of namespaces, to which you can add the project and project models namespaces so that they'll be available in all of the views. This will allow us to remove all of the redundant namespaces in the views, including any @using directives that have been used.
	  <namespaces>
        <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc" />
        <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc.Ajax" />
        <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc.Html" />
        <add namespace="System.Web.Optimization"/>
        <add namespace="System.Web.Routing" />
        <add namespace="HPlusSports"/>
        <add namespace="HPlusSports.Models"/>
      </namespaces>


==========================================================================
* (Customizing Routes with Attribute Routing) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In RouteConfig.cs you can implement custom routing by adding the following line
			routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();
This allows us to add attributes on top of controller actions to specify custom routing.

For example, in our HomeController.cs, if we want to specify that our 'home/contact' route should instead just be '/contact', we can add the	  [Route("contact")] decoration above the Contact() action

		[Route("contact")]
		public ActionResult Contact()
		{
			return View(); 
		}

We can also specify a secondary (made optional by adding the nullable character '?') parameter inside our custom routing decoration. This makes it so that instead of the default 'home/about' routing behavior, it will now route to just '/about'. The optional secondary parameter allows the next part of the path to either be empty, or to pass in a value that gets used and returned to the view. So if we navigate to '/about/Stephanie' the value 'name = Stephanie' will get passed in and consumed by the view.

		[Route("about/{name?}")]
		public ActionResult About(string name)
		{ 
			ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page " + name;
			return View();
		}

Additionally, if we want to specify a route for the entire controller, we can add it at the top of the controller class as  [RoutePrefix("home/{name}")]	 which will route all of the ActionResults contained within it to /home/{string parameter that can be used further down}.
For example, navigating to '/home/Stephanie/about' would then display "Your application description page Stephanie".

	[RoutePrefix("home/{name}")]
	public class HomeController : Controller
	{ 
	...
		[Route("about")]
		public ActionResult About(string name)
		{
			ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page " + name;
			return View();
		}

		public ActionResult Contact()
		{
			ViewBag.Message = "Your contact page.";
			return View();
		}
	...
	}

(^The final example with RoutePrefix() isn't useful for this project)


==========================================================================
* (Elmah) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin role auto-seeded into database as:
	admin@hplussports.com // password
This allows us to access the advanced error reporting that comes with the nuget package 'elmah'. The access details for this are configured in web.config appSettings. Currently you must be a user with the role of admin, and to view the elmah error reporting we can go to whatever site we're debugging at (i.e. 'https://localhost:44350/elmah' or 'http://localhost:65128/elmah') to view more explicit error details.

web.config:
	<appSettings>
		<add key="elmah.mvc.disableHandler" value="false" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.disableHandleErrorFilter" value="false" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.requiresAuthentication" value="true" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.IgnoreDefaultRoute" value="false" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.allowedRoles" value="Admin" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.allowedUsers" value="*" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.route" value="elmah" />
		<add key="elmah.mvc.UserAuthCaseSensitive" value="true" />
	</appSettings>

(^As of 2021 there are more comprehensive and widely used error reporting options than elmah, though it is still used for situations in which complex error reporting isn't necessary)


==========================================================================
* (Using Extension Methods to Remove Magic Strings) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A magic string is just a string that you've hardcoded into your program, possibly several times, or with unspecific/confusing variable names. The main problem with magic strings is that they aren't checked at compile time, which means that the program will build without any errors, even if you've accidentally introduced a typo, or if it's used in several places but you've forgotten to update the value in every one of those places. This can also be a problem if you unintentionally use the same variable name for two different strings (ie. name="username" and name="firstname") - so if you were to do a Find & Replace, you might accidentally rename both variables and break the program.
* To guard against the type of bugs magic strings can introduce, it is better to instead declare the string as a constant, and perhaps in a common global file.

Magic strings are values like
	TempData["SuccessMessage"] = $"Succesfully added {item.Name} to the cart"; 
This is used to pass a success message from one controller action to a view in another controller action via the TempData property. These values, however, provide no compile-time guarantee that you've actually gotten the right data.

Extension methods can only live in static classes, so adding custom extension methods like TempDataExtensions.cs will need to be made static.

Dropping the namespace from GivingTree.Web.Extensions to GivingTree.Web will make it so the class is available throughout the application, without having to explicitly import the namespace. 


==========================================================================
* (Using Extension Methods to Strongly Type Common Actions) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It can be useful to create a strongly typed wrapper around the Url.Action() Url Helper method because it can reduce the amount of duplicate code and magic strings. 


==========================================================================
* TryUpdateModel *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TryUpdateModel() allows you to bind parameters to your model inside your controller action. This is useful if you want to load a model from a database and then update it based on user input, rather than taking the entire model from user input. It behaves similarly to UpdateModel(), but returns true or false depending on if the update was a success. UpdateModel() throws an exception in the case of an error, which can be harder to debug.
In most cases you usually want to use one of the overloads of the method which allows you to limit which properties can be updated. You can do this by either passing a whitelist of properties that may be updated, or a blacklist of properties which may not be updated. Failing to do so may allow malicious users to exploit the program by updating properties you may not have intended to give access to.

* (Other Notes) *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* In order to get SchoolContext (ContosoUniversity) database to seed it needed to use the existing migrations folder to fastforward a new database into the one laid out there. Normally to instantiate a new db with migrations you put the following commands into the package manager console: 

		Enable-Migrations
		Add-Migration Init
		Update-Database
* However, since the project already had a migrations folder, we just needed to call the update-database command to instantiate the db. Also, the project's web.config also contained a refrence to which seed data entity should use in re-instantiating the database:

  <entityFramework>
    <contexts>
      <context type="ContosoUniversity.DAL.SchoolContext, ContosoUniversity">
        <databaseInitializer type="ContosoUniversity.DAL.SchoolInitializer, ContosoUniversity" />
      </context>
    </contexts>
    <defaultConnectionFactory type="System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.LocalDbConnectionFactory, EntityFramework">
      <parameters>
        <parameter value="v11.0" />
      </parameters>
    </defaultConnectionFactory>
    <providers>
      <provider invariantName="System.Data.SqlClient" type="System.Data.Entity.SqlServer.SqlProviderServices, EntityFramework.SqlServer" />
    </providers>
  </entityFramework>
